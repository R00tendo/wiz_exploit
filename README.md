# wiz_exploit
Hello! I was playing around and then i for some reason decided to hack my smart lights so i just connected my phone to the same network via wifi
and arpspoofed all the packets, then i turned the lights off, etc... Then i just replicated those packets in python and wouldn't you know it, it worked.


Usage:



color change:
python3 wiz-hack.py red green blue  
#instead of those words you ofcourse fill out the rgb values for example, green would be  0 255 0


on/off:
python3 wiz-hack.py off

python3 wiz-hack.py on


Ya, really simple but i just wanted to publish this.
