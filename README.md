# wiz_exploit
I was just playing around with my smart lights so i connected my phone to the same network via wifi
and arpspoofed all the packets, then i turned the lights off, etc... Then i just replicated those packets in python and wouldn't you know it, it worked.


## Usage:



Change color:

`python3 wiz-hack.py red green blue`
instead of those words you of course fill out the rgb values for example, green would be  0 255 0


on/off:

`python3 wiz-hack.py off`

`python3 wiz-hack.py on`


Ya, really simple but i just wanted to publish this.
